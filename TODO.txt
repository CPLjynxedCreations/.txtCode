**TODO**

*UPDATE NEW / LOAD VOIDS FROM DATA
*CREATE BOOL FOR MATCHING PASSWORD
*LOOP FOR PASSWORD CREATION
*NAME COMFIRMATION


New viod to stop doubling lines after password retry
	maybe bool too

no empty readlines
user no special keys

ending file needs wait for key press not readline
exit string
	checking if any readline contains exit > end file
		Environment.Exit();??

overwrite old file data for stats
	prefer just them lines so no password or user changed
	otherwise overwrite entire files and safe new lines
